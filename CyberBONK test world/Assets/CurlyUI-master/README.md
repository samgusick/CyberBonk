# CurlyUI
A Unity UI extension that curls UIs. With CurlyUI (CUI), UIs can be changed into different shapes by curving/morphing.

CUI should work with most of the Unity UI. For Image, use CUIImage; for Text, use CUIText; and for others (e.g. RawImage), use CUIGraphic.

When CUI components are added, change the control points of the top and bottom bezier curves to curve/morph the UI.

When curving/morphing UIs, if the UI seems to look poorly, improve the resolution. It should help.
